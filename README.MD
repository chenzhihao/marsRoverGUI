# Mars Rover GUI

This is the GUI for Mars Rover, the all MarsRover logic is from "MarsRover"repo, I only override Controller.js
to GUIController.js for some methods. Please check the GUIController.js for details.

## How to execute code:
Let us install all the dependency firstly:
```shell
 yarn install
 # Or
 npm install
```

Then we can do build and launch a http-server at http://localhost:8080/
```shell
 npm run start
```
